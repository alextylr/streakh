# Streakh

Streakh (the h is for aesthetics) is a tool created to help humans gradually build new habits! It prompts the user to answer specific questions about the habit they would like to implement to ensure they set small, achievable goals. Once the habit is established, the user can log each day that they complete the task a build up a streak(h)! 

The application displays a 30 day calendar on the UI, and once they have successfully completed their habit, it will add an indicator to the calendar on that particular day. This functionality was inspired by Jerry Seinfeld's productivity tip where he says that everyday he wrote new jokes, he would write a big red X for that day on his calendar, and his rule is "Don't Break the Chain".
